# Help Identify My Issues with Automatic Checks - Third-party tools

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

The check on this page will help identify some of the most common configuration challenges. You can use the automatic check below to validate your configuration and help you update your environment.

You'll be asked to sign-in on a new page. If you already have a user account select **sign-in**.  You won't need an Azure ID account. You might be asked for a user account again when the checks run. Use your _user name_@_yourFQDN_ and your password.

## Prerequisites

We'll check to see if you have the necessary pre-requisites on your Windows 7 x64 or Windows Server 2008 R2 computer automatically.
